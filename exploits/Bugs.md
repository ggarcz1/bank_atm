# Bugs and Exploits

#### Bug #1:

Traversal to a user without authentication:
http://127.0.0.1:5000/user/{username}
User enumeration of a URL
Bruteforce of usernames of this address and an apprpriate response.  Any request that comes back with "ERROR:" in the response.text field is not a valid user.

See **bug_1.py** for exploit



#### Bug #2:
all users are valid using bug#1, there is no check for this --> further development of the backend database.  
Fixed --> check is made in the "username" field for if the user exists in the database


#### Bug #3:
Username is present at the end of the URL

http://127.0.0.1:5000/user/{username}

Added session['user'] = username
removed passing of variable 'username' directly into the method to load and compare logon data
@app.route('**/user/{username}**', methods=['GET', 'POST']) --> @app.route('**/user**', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def logged_in **(username)**: --> def logged_in **()**:

#### Bug #4:
admin admin logon results in "hello John"
in the method **get_account_details**
{'first_name':'John',
'last_name':'Doe',
...
}

testing return value was updated to:
    account_details = {'first_name':'FirstName',
                       'last_name':'LastName',
                       'balance': 23344.12,
                       'email':'email@domain.com',
                       'account_number': '12345678',
                       'zipcode': 12345}

#### Bug #5:
Unencrypted communications (HTTP)
